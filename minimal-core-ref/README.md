# This is a clone of the important parts of Minimal style
Thus, these folders should be located at the root of the repo.

The purpose of including this reference here is to be able to finely tune minimal to my own template.

NB: If you want to include and make changes to any of the directories in this reference, it is imperative that you copy the current files over as well!
All of these directories are loaded with your site and you will break the theme if you do not carry these files over.
The only exception to this is the assests/css/style.css file. It was configured upon making this repo. You may leave there and add your css or @import statements there.
